ACT I
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
    FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO 
BERNARDO
    Who's there?
FRANCISCO
    Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
BERNARDO
    Long live the king!
FRANCISCO
    Bernardo?
BERNARDO
    He.
FRANCISCO
    You come most carefully upon your hour.
BERNARDO
    'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
FRANCISCO
    For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
BERNARDO
    Have you had quiet guard?
FRANCISCO
    Not a mouse stirring.
BERNARDO
    Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
FRANCISCO
    I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
    Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
HORATIO
    Friends to this ground.
MARCELLUS
    And liegemen to the Dane.
FRANCISCO
    Give you good night.
MARCELLUS
    O, farewell, honest soldier:
    Who hath relieved you?
FRANCISCO
    Bernardo has my place.
    Give you good night.
    Exit
MARCELLUS
    Holla! Bernardo!
BERNARDO
    Say,
    What, is Horatio there?
HORATIO
    A piece of him.
BERNARDO
    Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
MARCELLUS
    What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
BERNARDO
    I have seen nothing.
MARCELLUS
    Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
    Therefore I have entreated him along
    With us to watch the minutes of this night;
    That if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
HORATIO
    Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
BERNARDO
    Sit down awhile;
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story
    What we have two nights seen.
HORATIO
    Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
BERNARDO
    Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one,--
    Enter Ghost
MARCELLUS
    Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
BERNARDO
    In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
MARCELLUS
    Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
BERNARDO
    Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
HORATIO
    Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
BERNARDO
    It would be spoke to.
MARCELLUS
    Question it, Horatio.
HORATIO
    What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
MARCELLUS
    It is offended.
BERNARDO
    See, it stalks away!
HORATIO
    Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
    Exit Ghost
MARCELLUS
    'Tis gone, and will not answer.
BERNARDO
    How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
HORATIO
    Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
MARCELLUS
    Is it not like the king?
HORATIO
    As thou art to thyself:
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he the ambitious Norway combated;
    So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
MARCELLUS
    Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
HORATIO
    In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
MARCELLUS
    Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
    Who is't that can inform me?
HORATIO
    That can I;
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
    For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
    Against the which, a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
    As it doth well appear unto our state--
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
BERNARDO
    I think it be no other but e'en so:
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
    That was and is the question of these wars.
HORATIO
    A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
    As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
    But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
    Re-enter Ghost
    I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me:
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
    Speak to me:
    Cock crows
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
    For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
    Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
MARCELLUS
    Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
HORATIO
    Do, if it will not stand.
BERNARDO
    'Tis here!
HORATIO
    'Tis here!
MARCELLUS
    'Tis gone!
    Exit Ghost
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
BERNARDO
    It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
HORATIO
    And then it started like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    The extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine: and of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.
MARCELLUS
    It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
    And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
    The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
HORATIO
    So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
MARCELLUS
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.
    Exeunt
SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.
    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants 
KING CLAUDIUS
    Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
    With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
    Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
    Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
    His further gait herein; in that the levies,
    The lists and full proportions, are all made
    Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the king, more than the scope
    Of these delated articles allow.
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND
    In that and all things will we show our duty.
KING CLAUDIUS
    We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
    Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
    And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
LAERTES
    My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
LORD POLONIUS
    He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
    I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
HAMLET
    [Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
KING CLAUDIUS
    How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
HAMLET
    Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
    Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
HAMLET
    Ay, madam, it is common.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
HAMLET
    Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play:
    But I have that within which passeth show;
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
KING CLAUDIUS
    'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father:
    But, you must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd:
    For what we know must be and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd: whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father: for let the world take note,
    You are the most immediate to our throne;
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son,
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire:
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
    I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
HAMLET
    I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
KING CLAUDIUS
    Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
    This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
    Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
    Exeunt all but HAMLET
HAMLET
    O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
    Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
    So excellent a king; that was, to this,
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
    Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
    Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
    O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
    Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules: within a month:
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not nor it cannot come to good:
    But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.

    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
    In filial obligation for some term
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    In that and all things will we show our duty.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
    In what particular thought to work I know not;
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,

    Is it not like the king?

    I think it be no other but e'en so:
    It is most retrograde to our desire:
    It is not nor it cannot come to good:
    It is offended.
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
    It would be spoke to.

    Last night of all,
    Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
    Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
LORD POLONIUS
    Long live the king!
    Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.

    Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
    Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
    My dread lord,
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
    Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
    Not a mouse stirring.
    Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
    O, farewell, honest soldier:
    Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
    Of mine own eyes.
    Of these delated articles allow.
    Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
    Passing through nature to eternity.
    Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!

    Question it, Horatio.
    Re-enter Ghost
    Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
    Say,
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.
    See, it stalks away!
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
    Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    Sit down awhile;
    Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
    So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
    So excellent a king; that was, to this,
    So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
    So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
    Speak to me:
    Speak to me:
    Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
    Such was the very armour he had on
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
    Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
    Than I to Hercules: within a month:
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    Than that which dearest father bears his son,
    That are so fortified against our story
    That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
    That can I;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    That if again this apparition come,
    That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    That was and is the question of these wars.
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
    Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
    The bell then beating one,--
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    The extravagant and erring spirit hies
    The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    The lists and full proportions, are all made
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
    Therefore I have entreated him along
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
    The source of this our watch and the chief head
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
    This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
    'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
    This present object made probation.
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
    Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    'Tis gone, and will not answer.
    'Tis gone!
    'Tis here!
    'Tis here!
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
    'Tis strange.
    'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    To business with the king, more than the scope
    To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    To give these mourning duties to your father:
    To his confine: and of the truth herein
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
    To offer it the show of violence;
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    To reason most absurd: whose common theme
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
    Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
    Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
    Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
    Well, good night.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Well, sit we down,
    What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
    What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
    What, is Horatio there?
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    What think you on't?
    What we have two nights seen.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
    When he the ambitious Norway combated;
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
    Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
    Who hath relieved you?
    Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
    Who is't that can inform me?
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Who's there?
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
    With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
    With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    With us to watch the minutes of this night;
    With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
    Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
    Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    You are the most immediate to our throne;
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
    You come most carefully upon your hour.
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?

    The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
    In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
    The source of this our watch and the chief head
    But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
    It is offended.
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    When he the ambitious Norway combated;
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    An understanding simple and unschool'd:
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
    Do, if it will not stand.
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    [Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    Friends to this ground.
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    It is not nor it cannot come to good:
    As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
    Have you had quiet guard?

    If it be,

    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    To offer it the show of violence;
    The lists and full proportions, are all made
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
    Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
    Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
    'Tis strange.
    He.
    Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
    Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
    The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
    How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
    For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
    How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
    Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
    Sit down awhile;
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    To reason most absurd: whose common theme
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
    Who is't that can inform me?
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
    That if again this apparition come,
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
    Speak to me:
    Speak to me:
    And liegemen to the Dane.
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
    Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
    The bell then beating one,--
    'Tis gone!
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    You are the most immediate to our throne;
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    To business with the king, more than the scope
    'Tis here!
    'Tis here!
    Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
    What, is Horatio there?
    I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
    Who's there?
    It is most retrograde to our desire:
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
    As it doth well appear unto our state--
    As of a father: for let the world take note,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
    He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    Before my God, I might not this believe
    And with no less nobility of love
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
    Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
    Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
    As thou art to thyself:
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
    I have seen nothing.
    And then it started like a guilty thing
    Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
    Is it not like the king?
    Long live the king!
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
    Not a mouse stirring.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
    Therefore I have entreated him along
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
    Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
    Than I to Hercules: within a month:
    By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
    'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    That can I;
ACT I
    Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
    Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
    Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    Last night of all,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
    That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
    For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    A piece of him.
    Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    In filial obligation for some term
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
    Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
    Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
    What we have two nights seen.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
    But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
    And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    To his confine: and of the truth herein
    Such was the very armour he had on
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
    This present object made probation.
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    For what we know must be and is as common
    Ay, madam, it is common.
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
    O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
    Than that which dearest father bears his son,
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
    Well, sit we down,
    As if increase of appetite had grown

    O, farewell, honest soldier:
    To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
    Giving to you no further personal power
    'Tis gone, and will not answer.
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:

    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    The extravagant and erring spirit hies
    His further gait herein; in that the levies,
    Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
    And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,

    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    Of mine own eyes.
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    So excellent a king; that was, to this,
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    That was and is the question of these wars.
    Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress

    Well, good night.
    Give you good night.

    What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,

    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    Exit
    O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
    Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
    Against the which, a moiety competent
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    What think you on't?
    Exeunt
    In what particular thought to work I know not;
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    And I am sick at heart.
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Enter Ghost
    Re-enter Ghost
    Exit Ghost
    Exit Ghost
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
    Who hath relieved you?
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
    Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
    Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
    It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
    But I have that within which passeth show;
    Of these delated articles allow.
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
    For they are actions that a man might play:
    Say,
    Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
    See, it stalks away!
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
    Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
    That are so fortified against our story
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    In that and all things will we show our duty.
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
